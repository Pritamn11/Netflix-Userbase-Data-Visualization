# Netflix-Userbase-Data-Visualization

This repository contains the code and data for a data analysis project on Netflix's userbase. The project aims to understand the demographics of Netflix users, their viewing habits, and the revenue users generate.

Limitations: The analysis is limited by the availability of data. Netflix does not release all of its data to the public.
